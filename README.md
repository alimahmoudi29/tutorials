# tutorials

A set of tutorials for the tskit ecosystem build using 
[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)


**Under construction**

These are quick notes for developers while the real developers page is 
under construction.

- To add a new tutorial, create a Markdown file and add its name to ``_toc.yml``.
- If you are basing the tutorial on an existing notebook, use 
  [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) to convert the notebook into
  the right format.
- To build locally, run ``make``. The output tells you where to find the 
  built HTML.
- Pages rendered at https://tskit-dev.github.io/tutorials/ 
- Pages might take a while to be updated after a new tutorial is merged.

If you have an idea for a tutorial, please open an issue to discuss.
